Review
Finding bugs is a huge part of a programmer’s life. Don’t be intimidated by them… embrace them. Errors in your code mean you’re trying to do something cool!

In this lesson, we have learned about the four types of C++ errors:

Compile-time errors: Errors found by the compiler.
Link-time errors: Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable program.
Run-time errors: Errors found by checks in a running program.
Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.
Remember, Google and Stack Overflow are a programmer’s best friends. For some more motivation, check out this blog post: Thinking About Errors in Your Code Differently.

We wish you the best of luck in your bug-squashing journey.
