/*
Protected Members

You work at a grocery store and want to build an app to manage the products in the store.
You make a Product base class and separate classes for each product type.
Inherit the Fruit class from Product and make sure the given code works correctly.

The code tries to access the private members of Product in the Fruit class. Fix it by applying the correct access specifier
